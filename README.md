## Problem Statement

Methotrexate is a medication that helps to treat a range of conditions, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. It is a powerful drug that can have serious side effects if not taken correctly.

The current process for prescribing methotrexate is paper-based and can be confusing for patients. This can lead to errors in the way the medication is taken, which can be dangerous.

We would like to develop a digital solution that makes it easier for patients to understand how to take methotrexate safely.

## Solution

We need two solutions:

We need a database that can act as a pateitn record, paetients can access this information and submit changes.

Systems can then access this data for various uses including notifying pateints of blood tests and results.
